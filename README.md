2. *Pixel Color Display:* Display the RGB color of the pixel under the mouse cursor in real-time.
3. *Average Color Calculation:* Calculate and display the average color of a square area around the cursor.
4. *Color Selection:* Allow users to click on the image to select and store colors.
5. *Color Display:* Display selected colors below the canvas for easy reference.
6. *Hexadecimal Conversion:* Convert RGB color values to hexadecimal format for color display.
7. *User Interface:* Provide a clean and intuitive user interface for smooth interaction.

### Technologies:
- *JavaScript:* For implementing interactivity and logic.
- *HTML/CSS:* For creating the user interface and layout.
- *Canvas API:* For rendering the image and capturing pixel data.
- *Event Handling:* Utilize mouse events for interaction with the canvas.
- *Local Storage:* Store selected colors locally for persistence across sessions.

### Stretch Goals (Optional):

1. *Setup:** Create the basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. *Canvas Rendering:* Implement canvas rendering of the image and basic interaction.
3. *Pixel Color Display:* Display the RGB color of the pixel under the mouse cursor.
4. *Average Color Calculation:** Calculate and display the average color of a surrounding area.
5. *Color Selection:* Implement click event handling to select and store colors.
6. *Color Display:* Display selected colors below the canvas.
7. *Hexadecimal Conversion:** Convert RGB colors to hexadecimal format for display.
8. *Polishing:* Add styling, animations, and refine user interactions.
9. *Testing:* Test the application for usability, responsiveness, and performance.
10. *Deployment:* Deploy the application to a web server for public access.
